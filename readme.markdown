# Passphrase Guesser

A toy project to experiment with how a passphrase attack fairs when using word lists that differ slightly with the user.

## Preliminary results/output

```
Using user's exact word list and guessing randomly: Over 1M cracks, mean number of guesses was 64.033763
Using a super-set word list and guessing randomly: Over 1M cracks, mean number of guesses was 125.057523
---------------------------------
Using user's word list and more more traditional brute-force procedure: Over 1M cracks, mean number of guesses was 32.502167
Using a super-set word list and more traditional brute-force procedure: Over 1M cracks, mean number of guesses was 47.520139
