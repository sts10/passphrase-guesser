# Passphrase Guesser

A toy project to experiment with how a passphrase attack fairs when using word lists that differ slightly with the user.

## Preliminary results/output

```
Using user's exact word list: Over 1M cracks, mean number of guesses was 63.965295
Using a super-set word list: Over 1M cracks, mean number of guesses was 125.025081
```
