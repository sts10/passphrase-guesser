# Passphrase Guesser

A toy project to experiment with how a passphrase attack fairs when using slightly different word lists (compared to the user).

## Preliminary results/output

```
Using exact word list: Over 1M cracks, mean number of guesses was 64.163107
Using plus-one word list: Over 1M cracks, mean number of guesses was 124.916137
```
